# ExamRepositoryAPIProject
An API project for exam purpose only.
I created here a simple API using C# codes.
What interest here is that the code can return an array of string mostly to JSON format and it has a functionality to upload a file to the server. The upload can be a dragged and dropped from desktop to the form. Plus, it has functionalities with angularJS format structure.

Assuming that this is a project needs to be done that it must loop through the process of submission and getting the result.
